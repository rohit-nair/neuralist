He'd never stood one single time to prove the county wrong
His mama named him Tommy; the folks just called him 'Yellow'
But something always told me they were reading Tommy wrong

He was only ten years old when his daddy died in prison
I looked after Tommy 'cause he was my brother's son
I still recall the final words my brother said to Tommy
""Son, my life is over, but yours is just begun""

""Promise me, son, not to do the things I've done
Walk away from trouble if you can
It won't mean you're weak if you turn the other cheek
I hope you're old enough to understand
Son, you dont have to fight to be a man""

There's someone for everyone, and Tommy's love was Becky
In her arms, he didn't have to prove he was a man
One day, while he was workin', the Gatlin boys came callin'
They took turns at Becky; there was three of them

Tommy opened up the door and saw his Becky cryin'
The torn dress, the shattered look was more than he could stand
He reached above the fireplace and took down his daddy's picture
As his tears fell on his daddy's face, he heard these words again:

""Promise me, son, not to do the things I've done
Walk away from trouble if you can
It won't mean you're weak if you turn the other cheek
I hope you're old enough to understand
Son, you dont have to fight to be a man""

The Gatlin boys just laughed at him when he walked into the barroom
One of them got up and met him halfway 'cross the floor
When Tommy turned around they said, ""Hey look! Ol' yellow's leavin'""
But you coulda heard a pin drop when Tommy stopped and blocked the door

Twenty years of crawlin' was bottled up inside him
He wasn't holdin nothin' back; he let 'em have it all
When Tommy left the barroom, not a Gatlin boy was standin'
He said, ""This one's for Becky,"" as he watched the last one fall
And I heard him say

""I promised you, dad, not to do the things you done
I walk away from trouble when I can
Now please dont think I'm weak, I didn't turn the other cheek

Standing in the sunlight laughing
Hiding 'hind a rainbow's wall

On a train bound for nowhere
I met up with a gambler
We were both too tired to sleep
So we took turns a-starin'
Out the window at the darkness
'Til boredom overtook us
And he began to speak

He said, ""Son, I've made a life
Out of readin' people's faces
Knowin' what the cards were
By the way they held their eyes
So if you don't mind my sayin'
I can see you're out of aces
For a taste of your whiskey
I'll give you some advice""

So I handed him my bottle
And he drank down my last swallow
Then he bummed a cigarette
And asked me for a light
And the night got deathly quiet
And his face lost all expression
He said, ""If you're gonna play the game, boy
You gotta learn to play it right""

Know when to fold 'em
Know when to walk away
And know when to run
You never count your money
When you're sittin' at the table

That the secret to survivin'
Is knowin' what to throw away
And knowin' what to keep
'Cause every hand's a winner
And every hand's a loser
And the best that you can hope for
Is to die in your sleep""

And when he'd finished speakin'
He turned back toward the window
Crushed out his cigarette
And faded off to sleep
And somewhere in the darkness
The gambler, he broke even
But in his final words I found
An ace that I could keep

To Tuesday and so slow?
Going down the old mine with a
Transistor radio

Standing in the sunlight laughing
Hiding 'hind a rainbow's wall
Slipping and a-sliding
All along the waterfall with you

Making love in the green grass
A-behind the stadium with you

Fold it lightly with a dream
Your lips and mine, two sips of wine

Three little kids for the flavor

Stir carefully through the days
See how the flavor stays

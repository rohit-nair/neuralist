but without you, i give up

i can't sing a love song

to touch your lips, to hold you near
when you say your prayers, try to understand
i've made mistakes, i'm just a man

when he holds you close, when he pulls you near
when he says the words you've been needing to hear
i wish i was him
with these words of mine
to say to you 'til the end of time

that i will love you baby, always

we got down to the gate
and i was dreaming of the night
would it turn out right?

each time we hear our favorite song
the memories come along
older times we're missing
spending the hours reminiscing

hurry, don't be late
i can't hardly wait

we'll go dancing in the dark
walking through the park
and reminiscing","heard it from a friend who

heard it from another you been messin' around

and the tales grow taller on down the line

so you take it on the run 

you're thinking up your white lies
you're putting on your bedroom eyes

1.0,"in a bar in toledo across from the depot
on a bar stool she took off her ring
i thought i'd get closer, so i walked on over
i sat down and asked her name
when the drinks finally hit her, she said, ""i'm no quitter
but i finally quit livin' on dreams
i'm hungry for laughter and here ever after
i'm after whatever the other life brings""

in the mirror i saw him and i closely watched him
i thought how he looked out of place
he came to the woman who sat there beside me
he had a strange look on his face
the big hands were calloused; he looked like a mountain
for a minute i thought i was dead
but he started shakin', his big heart was breakin'
he turned to the woman and said

""you picked a fine time to leave me, lucille
with four hungry children and a crop in the field
i've had some bad times, lived through some sad times
but this time your hurtin' won't heal
you picked a fine time to leave me, lucille""

after he left us, i ordered more whisky
i thought how she'd made him look small
from the lights of the bar room to a rented hotel room
we walked without talking at all
she was a beauty, but when she came to me
she must have thought i'd lost my mind
i couldn't hold her, 'cause the words that he told her
kept comin' back time after time

""you picked a fine time to leave me, lucille
with four hungry children and a crop in the field
i've had some bad times, lived through some sad times
but this time your hurtin' won't heal
you picked a fine time to leave me, lucille""

he'd never stood one single time to prove the county wrong
his mama named him tommy; the folks just called him 'yellow'
but something always told me they were reading tommy wrong

he was only ten years old when his daddy died in prison
i looked after tommy 'cause he was my brother's son
i still recall the final words my brother said to tommy
""son, my life is over, but yours is just begun""

""promise me, son, not to do the things i've done
walk away from trouble if you can
it won't mean you're weak if you turn the other cheek
i hope you're old enough to understand
son, you dont have to fight to be a man""

there's someone for everyone, and tommy's love was becky
in her arms, he didn't have to prove he was a man
one day, while he was workin', the gatlin boys came callin'
they took turns at becky; there was three of them

tommy opened up the door and saw his becky cryin'
the torn dress, the shattered look was more than he could stand
he reached above the fireplace and took down his daddy's picture
as his tears fell on his daddy's face, he heard these words again:

""promise me, son, not to do the things i've done
walk away from trouble if you can
it won't mean you're weak if you turn the other cheek
i hope you're old enough to understand
son, you dont have to fight to be a man""

the gatlin boys just laughed at him when he walked into the barroom
one of them got up and met him halfway 'cross the floor
when tommy turned around they said, ""hey look! ol' yellow's leavin'""
but you coulda heard a pin drop when tommy stopped and blocked the door

twenty years of crawlin' was bottled up inside him
he wasn't holdin nothin' back; he let 'em have it all
when tommy left the barroom, not a gatlin boy was standin'
he said, ""this one's for becky,"" as he watched the last one fall
and i heard him say

""i promised you, dad, not to do the things you done
i walk away from trouble when i can
now please dont think i'm weak, i didn't turn the other cheek
and papa, i sure hope you understand
sometimes you gotta fight when youre a man""

i just left my baby girl a message, said i won't be coming home
i'd rather be alone
she doesn't fully understand me
cause i'd rather leave than to cheat
if she gives me some time

i could be the man she needs
but there's a lot of lust inside me
and we've been together since our teenage years
i really don't mean to hurt her
but i need some time to be alone

(chorus)
but when you love someone
you just don't treat them bad
oh how, i feel so sad
now that i wanna leave
she's crying her heart to me
how could you let this be
i just need time to see
where i wanna be
where i wanna be

(verse two)
never did i imagine that you would play a major part
in decision that's so hard
do i leave? do i stay? do i go?
think about my life and what matters to me the most
girl, the love that we share is real
but in time your heart will heal
i'm not saying i'm gone but i
have to find what life is like without you

(chorus)","damn baby
just don't understand where we went wrong
i gave you my heart
i gave you my soul
i gave you...

as a matter of fact i was the one who said i love you first
it was about eight years ago, don't act like you don't know
we were sittin' at home in your mama's livin' room
cause, we couldn't be alone
see your mama knew i was something else, she knew how i felt
back then we were in school; and that's your favourite excuse
growin' up i was a fool; and i can't lie i'm missing you
listen and don't trip
i think i need a bottle with a genie in it
here's my wish list

first one, i would create a heart changing love
second one, i'll take yours and fill it all up
third one, but i don't need a lot of wishes cause i'll be okay if i get one

if i had one wish, we would be best friends
love would never end, it would just begin
if i had one wish, you would be my boo
promise to love you, trust me i'll trust you
if i had one wish, we would run away
making love all day, have us a baby
if i had one wish, i'd make you my whole life
and you'd be my wife, make it right this time

if i had one wish
one wish, one wish, one wish
one wish, one wish, one wish
one wish, one wish, one wish
one wish, one wish, one wish

now tell me is this the only way i can get you right back in
if so then searchin' i'll go, then i can have you for sho
then you'll be loving me, holding me, kissing me
so girl don't tell me what i'm feeling is make believe
i swear if i lose a second chance with you
i wouldn't know what to do
i'd probably check myself into some kind of clinic
i couldn't be alone because without you i'm sick
here's my wish list

first one, i would create a heart changing love
second one, i'll take yours and fill it all up
third one, but i don't need a lot of wishes cause i'll be okay if i get one

if i had one wish, we would be best friends

if i had one wish, we would run away
making love all day, have us a baby
if i had one wish, i'd make you my whole life
and you'd be my wife, make it right this time
if i had one wish

i don't even know how we ended upon this road
and, even though we are grown, girl i just want you to know

if i had one wish, we would be best friends
love would never end, it would just begin
if i had one wish, you would be my boo
promise to love you, trust me i'll trust you
if i had one wish, we would run away

the loving look that’s left your eyes

light in your head and dead on your feet
well, another crazy day
you'll drink the night away
and forget about everything

this city desert makes you feel so cold
it's got so many people, but it's got no soul
and it's taken you so long
to find out you were wrong
when you thought it held everything

you used to think that it was so easy
you used to say that it was so easy
but you're trying, you're trying now
another year and then you'd be happy
just one more year and then you'd be happy
but you're crying, you're crying now

way down the street there's a light in his place
he opens the door, he's got that look on his face
and he asks you where you've been
you tell him who you've seen
and you talk about anything

he's got this dream about buying some land
he's gonna give up the booze and the one night stands
and then he'll settle down
in some quiet little town
and forget about everything

but you know he'll always keep moving
you know he's never gonna stop moving
'cause he's rolling, he's the rolling stone
and when you wake up, it's a new morning
the sun is shining, it's a new morning
and you're going, you're going home"

finally got a call from a girl i wanna dig out
(what's up?) hooked it up on later as i hit the do'
thinking ""will i live another twenty-fo'?""

i gotta go 'cause i got me a drop top
and if i hit the switch, i can make the ass drop
had to stop at a red light
looking in my mirror, not a jacker in sight
and everything is alright
i got a beep from kim and she can fuck all night

called up the homies and i'm askin y'all
""which court are y'all playin' basketball?""
get me on the court and i'm trouble
last week, fucked around and got a triple double
freaking niggas every way like m.j.

drove to the pad and hit the showers
didn't even get no static from the cowards
'cause just yesterday them fools tried to blast me
saw the police and they rolled right past me

no flexin', didn't even look in a nigga's direction
as i ran the intersection
went to short dog's house, they was watchin' yo! mtv raps
what's the haps on the craps?

shake 'em up, shake 'em up, shake 'em up, shake 'em
roll 'em in a circle of niggas and watch me break 'em
with the seven, seven-eleven, seven-eleven
seven even back do' little joe

i picked up the cash flow
then we played bones and i'm yellin' ""domino!""
plus nobody i know got killed in south central l.a.
today was a good day (shit)

left my nigga's house paid (what)
picked up a girl i been tryin' to fuck since the twelfth grade
it's ironic, i had the brew she had the chronic
the lakers beat the supersonics

i felt on the big fat fanny
pulled out the jammy and killed the punanny
and my dick runs deep, so deep, so deep
put her ass to sleep

woke her up around one
she didn't hesitate, to call ice cube ""the top gun""
drove her to the pad and i'm coasting
took another sip of the potion, hit the three-wheel motion

i was glad everything had worked out
dropped her ass off and then chirped out
today was like one of those fly dreams
didn't even see a berry flashing those high beams

no helicopter looking for a murder
two in the morning, got the fat burger
even saw the lights of the goodyear blimp
and it read ""ice cube's a pimp."" (yeah)

drunk as hell but no throwing up
halfway home and my pager still blowing up

when you were mine
but now those days are memories in time

life's empty without you by my side
my heart belongs to you
no matter what i try

when i get the courage up to love somebody new
it always falls apart 'cause they just can't compare to you
your love won't release me, i'm bound under ball and chain
reminiscing our love as i watch four seasons change

in comes the winter breeze
that chills the air and drifts the snow
and i imagine kissing you under the mistletoe

when springtime makes its way here
lilac blooms reminds me of
the scent of your perfume

when summer burns with heat
i always get the hots for you
go skinny dippin' in the ocean
where we used to do

when autumn sheds the leaves
the trees are bare when you're not here
it doesn't feel the same
(it doesn't feel the same, oh)

remember the nights
when we closed our eyes (we closed our eyes)
and vowed that you and i
would be in love for all time

everytime i think about these things i shared with you
i break down and cry 'cause i get so emotional
until you release me i'm bound under ball and chain
reminiscing our love as i watch four seasons change

in comes the winter breeze
that chills the air and drifts the snow
and i imagine kissing you under the mistletoe

when you're not here
it doesn't feel the same

this loneliness has crushed my heart (it's killing me, baby)
please let me love again
'cause i need your love to comfort me and ease my pain
or four seasons will bring the loneliness again

in comes the winter breeze
that chills the air and drifts the snow
and i imagine kissing you under the mistletoe

when springtime makes its way here
lilac blooms reminds me of
the scent of your perfume

and she said you were in town
suddenly the memories came back to me
in my mind

how can i be strong?
i've asked myself
time and time i've said
that i'll never fall in love with you again

a wounded heart you gave
my soul you took away
good intentions you had many
i know you did

i come from a place that hurts
and god knows how i've cried
and i never want to return
never fall again

making love to you felt so good
and oh so right

how can i be strong?
i've asked myself
time and time i've said
that i'll never fall in love with you again

so here we are alone again
didn't think it'd come to this
and to know it all began
with just a little kiss

i've come too close to happiness
to have it swept away
don't think i can take the pain
never fall again

kinda late in the game
and my heart is in your hands
don't you stand there and then tell me
you love me, then leave again
'cause i'm falling in love with you again

hold me, hold me
don't ever let me go
say it just one time
say you love me
god knows i do love you again"

caught up in a world of uphill climbing

montell made no money and life sure was slow

and people thought the music that he made was good

there lived a d.j. and paul was his name
he came up to monty, this is what he said
""you and og are gonna make some cash
sell a million records and we'll make in a dash.""

oh i'm buzzing because  (this is how we do it)
south central does it like nobody does  (this is how we do it)
to all my neighbours you got much flava  (this is how we do it)
i'll never come wack on an old school track  (this is how we do it)

second one, i'll take yours and fill it all up
third one, but i don't need a lot of wishes cause i'll be okay if i get one

if i had one wish, we would be best friends
love would never end, it would just begin
if i had one wish, you would be my boo

0.18457,"on the first part of the journey
i was looking at all the life
there were plants and birds and rocks and things
there was sand and hills and rings

the first thing i met was a fly with a buzz
and the sky with no clouds
the heat was hot and the ground was dry
but the air was full of sound

i've been through the desert on a horse with no name
it felt good to be out of the rain
in the desert you can remember your name
'cause there ain't no-one for to give you no pain

lalala...

after two days in the desert sun
my skin began to turn red
after three days in the desert fun
i was looking at a river bed

and the story it told of a river that flowed
made me sad to think it was dead

you see, i've been through the desert on a horse with no name
it felt good to be out of the rain
in the desert you can remember your name
'cause there ain't no-one for to give you no pain

lalala...

after nine days i let the horse run free
'cause the desert had turned to sea
there were plants and birds and rocks and things
there was sand and hills and rings

the ocean is a desert with it's life underground
and a perfect disguise above
under the cities lies a heart made of ground
but the humans will give no love

you see, i've been through the desert on a horse with no name
it felt good to be out of the rain
in the desert you can remember your name
'cause there ain't no-one for to give you no pain

when you were mine
but now those days are memories in time

life's empty without you by my side
my heart belongs to you
no matter what i try

when i get the courage up to love somebody new
it always falls apart 'cause they just can't compare to you
your love won't release me, i'm bound under ball and chain
reminiscing our love as i watch four seasons change

in comes the winter breeze
that chills the air and drifts the snow
and i imagine kissing you under the mistletoe

when springtime makes its way here
lilac blooms reminds me of
the scent of your perfume

when summer burns with heat
i always get the hots for you
go skinny dippin' in the ocean
where we used to do

when autumn sheds the leaves
the trees are bare when you're not here
it doesn't feel the same
(it doesn't feel the same, oh)

remember the nights
when we closed our eyes (we closed our eyes)
and vowed that you and i
would be in love for all time

everytime i think about these things i shared with you
i break down and cry 'cause i get so emotional
until you release me i'm bound under ball and chain
reminiscing our love as i watch four seasons change

in comes the winter breeze
that chills the air and drifts the snow
and i imagine kissing you under the mistletoe

this loneliness has crushed my heart (it's killing me, baby)
please let me love again

or four seasons will bring the loneliness again

he'd never stood one single time to prove the county wrong
his mama named him tommy; the folks just called him 'yellow'
but something always told me they were reading tommy wrong

he was only ten years old when his daddy died in prison
i looked after tommy 'cause he was my brother's son
i still recall the final words my brother said to tommy
""son, my life is over, but yours is just begun""

""promise me, son, not to do the things i've done
walk away from trouble if you can
it won't mean you're weak if you turn the other cheek
i hope you're old enough to understand
son, you dont have to fight to be a man""

there's someone for everyone, and tommy's love was becky
in her arms, he didn't have to prove he was a man
one day, while he was workin', the gatlin boys came callin'
they took turns at becky; there was three of them

tommy opened up the door and saw his becky cryin'
the torn dress, the shattered look was more than he could stand
he reached above the fireplace and took down his daddy's picture
as his tears fell on his daddy's face, he heard these words again:

""promise me, son, not to do the things i've done
walk away from trouble if you can
it won't mean you're weak if you turn the other cheek
i hope you're old enough to understand
son, you dont have to fight to be a man""

the gatlin boys just laughed at him when he walked into the barroom
one of them got up and met him halfway 'cross the floor
when tommy turned around they said, ""hey look! ol' yellow's leavin'""
but you coulda heard a pin drop when tommy stopped and blocked the door

twenty years of crawlin' was bottled up inside him
he wasn't holdin nothin' back; he let 'em have it all
when tommy left the barroom, not a gatlin boy was standin'
he said, ""this one's for becky,"" as he watched the last one fall
and i heard him say

""i promised you, dad, not to do the things you done
i walk away from trouble when i can
now please dont think i'm weak, i didn't turn the other cheek
and papa, i sure hope you understand
sometimes you gotta fight when youre a man""

out the window at the darkness

so i handed him my bottle
and he drank down my last swallow
then he bummed a cigarette
and asked me for a light
and the night got deathly quiet
and his face lost all expression
he said, ""if you're gonna play the game, boy
you gotta learn to play it right""

in the night, no control
through the wall something's breaking
wearing white as you're walkin'
down the street of my soul

you take my self, you take my self control
you got me livin' only for the night
before the morning comes, the story's told
you take my self, you take my self control

another night, another day goes by
i never stop myself to wonder why
you help me to forget to play my role
you take my self, you take my self control

i, i live among the creatures of the night
i haven't got the will to try and fight
against a new tomorrow, so i guess i'll just believe it
that tomorrow never comes

a safe night, i'm living in the forest of my dream
i know the night is not as it would seem
i must believe in something, so i'll make myself believe it
that this night will never go

when you were mine
but now those days are memories in time

life's empty without you by my side
my heart belongs to you
no matter what i try

when i get the courage up to love somebody new
it always falls apart 'cause they just can't compare to you
your love won't release me, i'm bound under ball and chain
reminiscing our love as i watch four seasons change

in comes the winter breeze
that chills the air and drifts the snow
and i imagine kissing you under the mistletoe

when springtime makes its way here
lilac blooms reminds me of
the scent of your perfume

when summer burns with heat
i always get the hots for you
go skinny dippin' in the ocean
where we used to do

when autumn sheds the leaves
the trees are bare when you're not here
it doesn't feel the same
(it doesn't feel the same, oh)

remember the nights
when we closed our eyes (we closed our eyes)
and vowed that you and i
would be in love for all time

everytime i think about these things i shared with you
i break down and cry 'cause i get so emotional
until you release me i'm bound under ball and chain
reminiscing our love as i watch four seasons change

in comes the winter breeze
that chills the air and drifts the snow
and i imagine kissing you under the mistletoe

go skinny dippin' in the ocean where we used to do

when autumn sheds the leaves the trees are bare
when you're not here
it doesn't feel the same

this loneliness has crushed my heart (it's killing me, baby)
please let me love again
'cause i need your love to comfort me and ease my pain
or four seasons will bring the loneliness again

in comes the winter breeze

just don't understand where we went wrong
i gave you my heart
i gave you my soul
i gave you...

as a matter of fact i was the one who said i love you first
it was about eight years ago, don't act like you don't know
we were sittin' at home in your mama's livin' room
cause, we couldn't be alone
see your mama knew i was something else, she knew how i felt
back then we were in school; and that's your favourite excuse
growin' up i was a fool; and i can't lie i'm missing you
listen and don't trip
i think i need a bottle with a genie in it
here's my wish list

first one, i would create a heart changing love
second one, i'll take yours and fill it all up
third one, but i don't need a lot of wishes cause i'll be okay if i get one

if i had one wish, we would be best friends
love would never end, it would just begin
if i had one wish, you would be my boo
promise to love you, trust me i'll trust you
if i had one wish, we would run away
making love all day, have us a baby
if i had one wish, i'd make you my whole life
and you'd be my wife, make it right this time

if i had one wish
one wish, one wish, one wish
one wish, one wish, one wish
one wish, one wish, one wish
one wish, one wish, one wish

now tell me is this the only way i can get you right back in
if so then searchin' i'll go, then i can have you for sho
then you'll be loving me, holding me, kissing me
so girl don't tell me what i'm feeling is make believe
i swear if i lose a second chance with you
i wouldn't know what to do
i'd probably check myself into some kind of clinic
i couldn't be alone because without you i'm sick
here's my wish list

first one, i would create a heart changing love
second one, i'll take yours and fill it all up
third one, but i don't need a lot of wishes cause i'll be okay if i get one

(count on my love)

precious love, i'll give it to you
blue as the sky and deep
in the eyes of a love so true

beautiful face, you make me feel
light on the stairs and lost
in the air of a love so real

you can count on me
count on my love
count on me
count on my love","on the first part of the journey
i was looking at all the life
there were plants and birds and rocks and things
there was sand and hills and rings

the first thing i met was a fly with a buzz
and the sky with no clouds
the heat was hot and the ground was dry
but the air was full of sound

i've been through the desert on a horse with no name
it felt good to be out of the rain
in the desert you can remember your name
'cause there ain't no-one for to give you no pain

lalala...

after two days in the desert sun
my skin began to turn red
after three days in the desert fun
i was looking at a river bed

and the story it told of a river that flowed
made me sad to think it was dead

you see, i've been through the desert on a horse with no name
it felt good to be out of the rain
in the desert you can remember your name
'cause there ain't no-one for to give you no pain

lalala...

after nine days i let the horse run free
'cause the desert had turned to sea
there were plants and birds and rocks and things
there was sand and hills and rings

the ocean is a desert with it's life underground
and a perfect disguise above
under the cities lies a heart made of ground
but the humans will give no love

you see, i've been through the desert on a horse with no name
it felt good to be out of the rain
in the desert you can remember your name
'cause there ain't no-one for to give you no pain

first one, i would create a heart changing love
second one, i'll take yours and fill it all up
third one, but i don't need a lot of wishes cause i'll be okay if i get one

if i had one wish, we would be best friends
love would never end, it would just begin
if i had one wish, you would be my boo
promise to love you, trust me i'll trust you
if i had one wish, we would run away
making love all day, have us a baby
if i had one wish, i'd make you my whole life
and you'd be my wife, make it right this time

if i had one wish
one wish, one wish, one wish
one wish, one wish, one wish
one wish, one wish, one wish

if so then searchin' i'll go, then i can have you for sho
then you'll be loving me, holding me, kissing me

ice is back with my brand new invention
something grabs a hold of me tightly
flow like a harpoon daily and nightly

will it ever stop? yo, i don't know
turn off the lights and i'll glow
to the extreme i rock a mic like a vandal
light up a stage and wax a chump like a candle

dance! go rush the speaker that booms
i'm killin' your brain like a poisonous mushroom
deadly when i play a dope melody

with the bass kicked in and the vegas are pumpin'
quick to the point, to the point no faking
i'm cooking mcs like a pound of bacon

burning 'em if they're not quick and nimble
i go crazy when i hear a cymbal
and a hi-hat with a souped up tempo
i'm on a roll, it's time to go solo

rollin' in my 5.0
with my ragtop down so my hair can blow
the girlies on standby waving just to say, ""hi,""
did you stop? no, i just drove by

kept on pursuing to the next stop
i busted a left and i'm heading to the next block
that block was dead, yo
so, i continued to a1a beachfront avenue

girls were hot, wearing less than bikinis
rockman lovers driving lamborghinis
jealous, 'cause i'm out getting mine
shay with a gauge and vanilla with a nine

ready for the chumps on the wall
the chumps are acting ill because they full of eight ball
gunshots ranged out like a bell
i grabbed my nine, all i heard were shells

fallin' on the concrete real fast
jumped in my car, slammed on the gas
bumper to bumper, the avenue's packed
i'm tryin' to get away before the jackers jack

police on the scene, you know what i mean?
they passed me up, confronted all the dope fiends

my town that created all the bass sound
enough to shake and kick holes in the ground

'cause my style's like a chemical spill
feasible rhymes that you can vision and feel
conducted and formed, this is a hell of a concept
we make it hype and you want to step with this

shay plays on the fade, slice like a ninja
cut like a razor blade
so fast, other djs say, ""damn""
if my rhyme was a drug, i'd sell it by the gram

keep my composure when it's time to get loose
magnetized by the mic while i kick my juice

a fresh cool young lu
trying to cash his microphone check two one two
want to believe my own hype but it's too untrue
the world brought me to my knees what have you brung you?
did you improve on the design? did you do something new?
well you're name ain't on the guest list, who brung you?
you, the more famous person you come through
and the sexy lady next to you, you come too
and then it hit me standing outside of heaven waitin' for god to come and get me
i'm too uncouth, unschool'd to the rules and too gum shoe
too much of a newcomer and too uncool
like shadow and lavelle i battle with it well
though i need a holiday like lady who sung blue
go back what ever you did you undo
heavy as heaven, the devil on my two tons too

we want it to braid meaning we want it to grow meaning we want it to stay
like the governor called and he told him to wait
un-strap him from the chair and put him back in his cage

eatin' burnt suppers the whole first year
and askin' for seconds to keep her from tearin' up

and he poured a glass
then i smiled and said,
""i'll have some of that.""

was the sight of her holdin' my  baby girl

married his high school love
and it's a new t-shirt saying ""i'm a grandpa""
and being right there as our time got small
and holdin' her hand when the good lord called her up
yeah man, that's the good stuff

he said, ""when you get home she'll start to cry,

never revealing their depth

instead of the gallows of heartache that hang from above

and i'll be your cryin' shoulder
i'll be love's suicide
and i'll be better when i'm older
i'll be the greatest fan of your life

and he poured a glass
then i smiled and said,

saw a black and white picture and it caught my stare
it was a pretty girl with bouffant hair

i'm hungry for laughter and here ever after
i'm after whatever the other life brings""

in the mirror i saw him and i closely watched him
i thought how he looked out of place
he came to the woman who sat there beside me
he had a strange look on his face
the big hands were calloused; he looked like a mountain
for a minute i thought i was dead
but he started shakin', his big heart was breakin'
he turned to the woman and said

she was a beauty, but when she came to me
she must have thought i'd lost my mind
i couldn't hold her, 'cause the words that he told her
kept comin' back time after time

they took turns at becky; there was three of them

tommy opened up the door and saw his becky cryin'
the torn dress, the shattered look was more than he could stand
he reached above the fireplace and took down his daddy's picture
as his tears fell on his daddy's face, he heard these words again:

""promise me, son, not to do the things i've done
walk away from trouble if you can
it won't mean you're weak if you turn the other cheek
i hope you're old enough to understand

he wasn't holdin nothin' back; he let 'em have it all

under the cities lies a heart made of ground

or maybe just need some sleep
i got a sick obsession
i'm seeing it in my dreams

i'm looking down every alley
i'm making those desperate calls
i'm staying up all night hoping
hit my head against the wall

what you got, boy, is hard to find
i think about it all the time
i'm all strung out, my heart is fried
i just can't get you off my mind

chorus:
because your love, your love
your love is my drug
your love, your love, your love
i said your love, your love
your love is my drug
your love, your love, your love

won't listen to any advice
mom's telling me i should think twice
but love to my own devices
i'm addicted, it's a crisis

my friends think i've gone crazy
my judgment's getting kinda hazy
my esteem is gonna be affected
if i keep it up like a lovesick crack-head

what you got boy is hard to find
i think about it all the time
(all the time)
i'm all strung out, my heart is fried
i just can't get you off my mind

because your love, your love
your love is my drug
your love, your love, your love
i said your love, your love
your love is my drug
your love, your love, your love

i don't care what people say
the rush is worth the price i pay
i get so high when you're with me
but crash and crave you when you leave

so i got a question:
do you wanna have a slumber party in my basement?
do i make your heart beat like an 808 drum?
is my love, huh your drug?
your drug, huh your drug
huh your drug, is my love your drug?

because your love, your love

i gave you my heart
i gave you my soul
i gave you...

as a matter of fact i was the one who said i love you first
it was about eight years ago, don't act like you don't know
we were sittin' at home in your mama's livin' room
cause, we couldn't be alone
see your mama knew i was something else, she knew how i felt
back then we were in school; and that's your favourite excuse
growin' up i was a fool; and i can't lie i'm missing you
listen and don't trip
i think i need a bottle with a genie in it
here's my wish list

first one, i would create a heart changing love
second one, i'll take yours and fill it all up
third one, but i don't need a lot of wishes cause i'll be okay if i get one

if i had one wish, we would be best friends
love would never end, it would just begin
if i had one wish, you would be my boo
promise to love you, trust me i'll trust you
if i had one wish, we would run away
making love all day, have us a baby
if i had one wish, i'd make you my whole life
and you'd be my wife, make it right this time

if i had one wish
one wish, one wish, one wish
one wish, one wish, one wish
one wish, one wish, one wish
one wish, one wish, one wish

now tell me is this the only way i can get you right back in
if so then searchin' i'll go, then i can have you for sho
then you'll be loving me, holding me, kissing me
so girl don't tell me what i'm feeling is make believe
i swear if i lose a second chance with you
i wouldn't know what to do
i'd probably check myself into some kind of clinic
i couldn't be alone because without you i'm sick

i wish i had a girl who looked good i would call her
i wish i had a rabbit in a hat with a bat
and a 64' impala

i wish i was like six-foot-nine 
so i can get with leoshi, cause she don't know me, but yo she's really fine
you know i see her all the time
everywhere i go and even in my dreams i can scheme a way to make her mine
cause i know she's livin phat
her boyfriend's tall and he plays ball, so how am i gonna compete with that
'cause when it comes to playing basketball
i'm always last to be picked and in some cases never picked at all
so i just lean up on the wall
or sit up in the bleachers with the rest of the girls who came to watch their men ball
dag y'all! i never understood, black
why the jocks get the fly girls and me i get the hood rats
i tell 'em scat, skittle, scabobble
got hit with a bottle and i been in the hospital for talkin' that mess
i confess it's a shame 
when you livin' in a city that's the size of a box and nobody knows yo' name
glad i came to my senses 
like quick-quick got sick-sick to my stomach overcommeth 
by the thoughts of me and her together, right? 
so when i asked her out she said i wasn't her type

i wish i was little bit taller, i wish i was a baller,
i wish i had a girl who looked good i would call her
i wish i had a rabbit in a hat with a bat
and a 64' impala

i wish i was little bit taller, i wish i was a baller,

i wish i had a brand-new car, so far i got this hatchback 
and everywhere i go, yo i gets laughed at
and when i'm in my car, i'm laid back
i got an 8-track and a spare tire in the backseat, but that's flat
and do you really wanna know what's really whack
see i can't even get a date, so what do you think of that?
i heard that prom night is a bomb night with the hood rats you can hold tight, but really tho' 
i 'm a figaro when i'm in my car i can't even get a hello
well so many people wanna cruise crenshaw on sunday
well then i'ma have to get in my car and go
you know i take the 110 until the 105
get off at crenshaw tell my homies look alive
cause it's hard to survive 
when your livin' in a concrete jungle and these girls just keep passin' me by
she looks fly, she looks fly
makes me say my, my, my

it's my life
my own words i guess

have you ever loved someone so much, you'd give an arm for?
not the expression, no, literally give an arm for
when they know they're your heart
and you know you were their armor

and you will destroy anyone who would try to harm 'em
but what happens when karma turns right around and bites you
and everything you stand for turns on you to spite you?
what happens when you become the main source of a pain?
""daddy, look what i made."", dad's gotta go catch a plane

""daddy, where's mommy? i can't find mommy, where is she?""
i don't know go play hailie, baby, your daddy's busy
daddy's writing this song, this song ain't gonna write itself
i'll give you one underdog then you gotta swing by yourself

then turn right around in that song and tell her you love her
and put hands on her mother, who's a spitting image of her
that's slim shady, yeah baby, slim shady's crazy
shady made me, but tonight shady's rock-a-bye baby

and when i'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn

i keep having this dream, i'm pushin' hailie on the swing
she keeps screaming, she don't want me to sing
""you're making mommy cry, why? why is mommy crying?""
baby, daddy ain't leaving no more, ""daddy you're lying,
you always say that, you always say this is the last time.
but you ain't leaving no more, daddy you're mine.""

she's pilling boxes in front of the door trying to block it
""daddy please, daddy don't leave, daddy - no stop it!""
goes in her pocket, pulls out a tiny necklace locket
it's got a picture, ""this'll keep you safe daddy, take it with ya.""

i look up, it's just me standing in the mirror
these fuckin' walls must be talking, 'cuz man i can hear 'em
they're saying ""you've got one more chance to do right,"" and it's tonight
now go out there and show that you love 'em before it's too late
and just as i go to walk out of my bedroom door
it turns to a stage, they're gone, and this spotlight is on
and i'm singing

the curtain closes, they're throwing roses at my feet
i take a bow and thank you all for coming out
they're screaming so loud, i take one last look at the crowd

i glance down, i don't believe what i'm seeing
""daddy it's me, help mommy, her wrists are bleeding,""
but baby we're in sweden, how did you get to sweden?
""i followed you daddy, you told me that you weren't leavin'

""you lied to me dad, and now you make mommy sad
and i bought you this coin, it says 'number one dad'.
that's all i wanted, i just want to give you this coin.
i get the point - fine, me and mommy are gone.""

but baby wait, ""it's too late dad, you made the choice.
now go up there and show 'em that you love 'em more than us.""
that's what they want, they want you marshall, they keep screamin' your name
it's no wonder you can't go to sleep, just take another pill
yeah, i bet you you will. you rap about it, yeah, word, k-keep it real

i hear applause, all this time i couldn't see
how could it be, that the curtain is closing on me
i turn around, find a gun on the ground, cock it
put it to my brain and scream ""die shady!"" and pop it

the sky darkens, my life flashes, the plane that i was supposed to be on crashes and burns to ashes
that's when i wake up, alarm clock's ringin', there's birds singin'
it's spring and hailie's outside swinging, i walk right up to kim and kiss her
tell her i miss her, hailie just smiles and winks at her little sister

my esteem is gonna be affected

do i make your heart beat like an 808 drum?

third one, but i don't need a lot of wishes cause i'll be okay if i get one

if i had one wish, we would be best friends

if i had one wish, you would be my boo

third one, but i don't need a lot of wishes cause i'll be okay if i get one

if i had one wish, we would be best friends
love would never end, it would just begin
if i had one wish, you would be my boo
promise to love you, trust me i'll trust you
if i had one wish, we would run away
making love all day, have us a baby

suddenly this crazy world made more sense to me
well, i heard it today and i couldn't help but sing along
'cause every time i hear that song

i go back to a two-ton short bed chevy
drivin' my first love out to the levee
livin' life with no sense of time
and i go back to the feel of a fifty yard line
a blanket, a girl, some raspberry wine
wishin' time would stop right in its tracks
every time i hear that song, i go back
i go back

well, i used to rock all night long
to 'keep on rock'n me, baby'
at frat parties, college bars, just tryin' to impress the ladies
well, i heard it today and i couldn't help but sing along
'cause everytime i hear that song

i go back to the smell of an old gym floor
the taste of salt on a carolina shore
after graduation and drinkin' goodbye to friends
and i go back to watchin' summer fade to fall
growin' up too fast and i do recall
wishing time would stop right in its tracks
everytime i hear that song, i go back
i go back

we all have a song that's somehow stamped our lives
that takes us to another place and time

so, i go back to the pew, preacher and a choir
singin' 'bout god and brimstone and fire
and the smell of sunday chicken after church
and i go back to the loss of a real good friend
and the sixteen summers i shared with him
now, 'only the good die young' stops me in my tracks
everytime i hear that song, i go back
i go back

to the feel of a fifty yard line

and the sixteen summers i shared with him
i go back
i go back","on a warm summer's evenin'
on a train bound for nowhere
i met up with a gambler
we were both too tired to sleep
so we took turns a-starin'
out the window at the darkness
'til boredom overtook us
and he began to speak

he said, ""son, i've made a life
out of readin' people's faces
knowin' what the cards were
by the way they held their eyes
so if you don't mind my sayin'
i can see you're out of aces
for a taste of your whiskey
i'll give you some advice""

so i handed him my bottle
and he drank down my last swallow
then he bummed a cigarette
and asked me for a light
and the night got deathly quiet
and his face lost all expression
he said, ""if you're gonna play the game, boy
you gotta learn to play it right""

you've got to know
when to hold 'em
know when to fold 'em
know when to walk away
and know when to run
you never count your money
when you're sittin' at the table
there'll be time enough for countin'
when the dealin's done

every gambler knows
that the secret to survivin'
is knowin' what to throw away
and knowin' what to keep
'cause every hand's a winner
and every hand's a loser
and the best that you can hope for
is to die in your sleep""

and when he'd finished speakin'
he turned back toward the window
crushed out his cigarette
and faded off to sleep
and somewhere in the darkness
the gambler, he broke even
but in his final words i found
an ace that i could keep

is knowin' what to throw away
and knowin' what to keep

down at the end lookin' half asleep

i said,""the good stuff""

he didn't pour me a beer

he said, ""spent five years in the bottle, when the cancer took her from me,
but i've been sober three years now

was the sight of her holdin' my  baby girl
the way she adored that string of pearls

married his high school love
and it's a new t-shirt saying ""i'm a grandpa""
and being right there as our time got small
and holdin' her hand when the good lord called her up

cause i'd rather leave than to cheat

but there's a lot of lust inside me
and we've been together since our teenage years
i really don't mean to hurt her
but i need some time to be alone

you just don't treat them bad
oh how, i feel so sad
now that i wanna leave
she's crying her heart to me
how could you let this be
i just need time to see
where i wanna be
where i wanna be

(verse two)
never did i imagine that you would play a major part
in decision that's so hard
do i leave? do i stay? do i go?
think about my life and what matters to me the most
girl, the love that we share is real
but in time your heart will heal
i'm not saying i'm gone but i
have to find what life is like without you

all i wanna do is have a little fun before i die
says the man next to me outta nowhere

it's apropos of nothing
he says his name is william
but i'm sure he's bill or billy or mac or buddy

and he's plain ugly to me
and i wonder if he's ever had a day of fun in his whole life

and we are drinking beer at noon on tuesday
in the bar that faces the giant car wash

and the good people of the world
are washing their cars
on their lunch breaks
hosing and scrubbing
as best they can
in skirts and suits

they drive their
shiny datsuns and buicks
back to the phone company
the record store too
well, they're nothing like billy and me

over santa monica boulevard

i like a good beer buzz early in the morning
and billy likes to peel the labels from his bottles of bud

and he shreds them on the bar
then he lights every match
in an over-sized pack
letting each one burn

down to his thick fingers
before blowing and cursing them out
he's watching the bottles of bud as they spin on the floor

and a happy couple enters the bar
dangerously close to one another
the bartender looks up from his want ads

but all i wanna do is have some fun
i got a feeling i'm not the only one
all i wanna do is have some fun
i got a feeling i'm not the only one

the day and the night and the car wash too
the matches and the buds and the clean and dirty cars
the sun and the moon

how did our eyes get so red?
and what the hell is on joey's head?

and this is where i grew up
i think the present owner fixed it up
i never knew we ever went without
the second floor is hard for sneakin' out

and this is where i went to school
most of the time had better things to do
criminal record says i broke in twice
i must've done it half a dozen times

i wonder if it's too late
should i go back and try to graduate?
life's better now than it was back then
if i was them, i wouldn't let me in

it's hard to say it

goodbye

remember the old arcade
blew every dollar that we ever made
the cops hated us hangin' out
they say somebody went and burned it down

we used to listen to the radio
and sing along with every song we'd know
we said someday we'd find out how it feels
to sing to more than just the steering wheel

kim's the first girl i kissed
i was so nervous that i nearly missed
she's had a couple of kids since then
i haven't seen her since god knows when

i miss their faces

there was sand and hills and rings

and the sky with no clouds
the heat was hot and the ground was dry
but the air was full of sound

i've been through the desert on a horse with no name
it felt good to be out of the rain
in the desert you can remember your name
'cause there ain't no-one for to give you no pain

lalala...

after two days in the desert sun
my skin began to turn red
after three days in the desert fun
i was looking at a river bed

and the story it told of a river that flowed
made me sad to think it was dead

you see, i've been through the desert on a horse with no name
it felt good to be out of the rain
in the desert you can remember your name
'cause there ain't no-one for to give you no pain

lalala...

after nine days i let the horse run free
'cause the desert had turned to sea
there were plants and birds and rocks and things
there was sand and hills and rings

the ocean is a desert with it's life underground
and a perfect disguise above
under the cities lies a heart made of ground
but the humans will give no love

it felt good to be out of the rain
in the desert you can remember your name

and billy likes to peel the labels from his bottles of bud

and he shreds them on the bar
then he lights every match
in an over-sized pack
letting each one burn

down to his thick fingers
before blowing and cursing them out
he's watching the bottles of bud as they spin on the floor

and a happy couple enters the bar
dangerously close to one another
the bartender looks up from his want ads

but all i wanna do is have some fun
i got a feeling i'm not the only one
all i wanna do is have some fun
i got a feeling i'm not the only one
all i wanna do is have some fun
until the sun comes up
over santa monica boulevard

otherwise, the bar is ours
the day and the night and the car wash too
the matches and the buds and the clean and dirty cars
the sun and the moon

but all i wanna do is have some fun
i got a feeling i'm not the only one
all i wanna do is have some fun
i got a feeling i'm not the only one

all i wanna do is have some fun
i got a feeling the party has just begun
all i wanna do is have some fun
i won't tell you that you're the only one
all i wanna do is have some fun
until the sun comes up
over santa monica boulevard

my skin began to turn red
after three days in the desert fun

made me sad to think it was dead

'cause the desert had turned to sea
there were plants and birds and rocks and things
there was sand and hills and rings

and a perfect disguise above
under the cities lies a heart made of ground
but the humans will give no love

when i get the courage up to love somebody new
it always falls apart 'cause they just can't compare to you
your love won't release me, i'm bound under ball and chain

in comes the winter breeze
that chills the air and drifts the snow

when springtime makes its way here
lilac blooms reminds me of
the scent of your perfume

when summer burns with heat

when autumn sheds the leaves
the trees are bare when you're not here
it doesn't feel the same
(it doesn't feel the same, oh)

remember the nights
when we closed our eyes (we closed our eyes)
and vowed that you and i
would be in love for all time

everytime i think about these things i shared with you
i break down and cry 'cause i get so emotional
until you release me i'm bound under ball and chain

i want a girl with extensions in her hair
bamboo earrings, at least two pair
a fendi bag and a bad attitude
that's all i need to get me in a good mood
she can walk with a switch and talk with street slang
i love it when a woman ain't scared to do her thing
standing at the bus stop, sucking on a lollipop
once she gets pumping, its hard to make the hottie stop
she likes to dance to the rap jam
she sweet as brown sugar with the candied yams
honey coated complexion, using camay
lets hear it for the girl she's from around the way

want to eat you like a cookie when i see you walk
with your rayon, silk, or maybe even denim

you can break hearts and manipulate minds
or surrender, act tender, be gentle and kind
you always know what to say and do
cold flip when you think your man is playing you
not cheap or petty , you're ready for lovin'

how do i live without you?","well, me and my lady had our first big fight
so i drove around till i saw the neon lights
the corner bar
it just seemed right, so i pulled up
not a soul around but the old bar keep 
down at the end lookin' half asleep 
he walked up and said ""what'll it be?""
i said,""the good stuff""
he didn't reach around for the whiskey
he didn't pour me a beer
his blue eyes kind of went misty
he said, ""you can't find that here.""

'cause its the first long kiss on a second date
your momma's all worried when you get home late
droppin' the ring in the spaghetti plate
'cause your hands are shakin so much
and it's the way that she looks with rice in her hair
eatin' burnt suppers the whole first year
and askin' for seconds to keep her from tearin' up
yeah man, that's the good stuff

he grabbed a carton of milk 
and he poured a glass
then i smiled and said,
""i'll have some of that.""
we sat there and talked as an hour passed
like old friends
saw a black and white picture and it caught my stare
it was a pretty girl with bouffant hair
he said, ""that's my bonnie, taken 'bout a year after we wed.""
he said, ""spent five years in the bottle, when the cancer took her from me,
but i've been sober three years now
'cause the one thing stronger than the whiskey

was the sight of her holdin' my  baby girl
the way she adored that string of pearls
i gave her the day that our youngest boy, earl
married his high school love
and it's a new t-shirt saying ""i'm a grandpa""
and being right there as our time got small
and holdin' her hand when the good lord called her up
yeah man, that's the good stuff

he said, ""when you get home she'll start to cry,
when she says, 'i'm sorry,' say 'so am i'
then look into those eyes so deep in love
and drink it up
'cause thats the good stuff
that's the good stuff"

you're gonna say, oh how much you missed me
you'll walk out this door
but someday you'll walk back in
darling i know, i know this will be

sometimes it takes, sometime out on your own now
to find your way back home

love will lead you back
someday i just know that
love will lead you back to my arms
where you belong

i'm sure, sure as stars are shining
one day you will find me again
it won't be long
one of these days our love will lead you back, oh

i won't try to stop you now from leaving
'cause in my heart i know, oh yeah

love will lead you back
someday i just know that
love will lead you back to my arms
where you belong

i'm sure, sure as stars are shining
one day you will find me again
it won't be long
one of these days our love will lead you back, oh yeah

love will lead you back
someday i just know that
love will lead you back to my arms
it won't be long

one of these days
our love will lead you back","in a lifetime
made of memories
i believe
in destiny
every moment returns again in time
when i've got the future on my mind
know that you'll be the only one

meet me halfway
across the sky
out where the world belongs
to only you and i

meet me halfway
across the sky
make this a new beginning of another life.

in a lifetime
there is only love
reaching for the lonely one
we are stronger when we are given love
when we put emotions on the line
know that we are the timeless ones

meet me halfway
across the sky
out where the world belongs
to only you and i

meet me halfway
across the sky
make this a new beginning of another life."

everybody was kung fu fighting
those cats were fast as lightning
in fact it was a little bit frightening
but they fought with expert timing

there were funky chinamen from funky chinatown
they were chopping them up, they were chopping them down
it's an ancient chinese art and everybody knew their part
from a feint into a slip and a kicking from the hip

everybody was kung fu fighting
those cats were fast as lightning
in fact it was a little bit frightening, yeah, yeah
but they fought with expert timing

there was funky billy chin and little sammy chung
he said: ""here comes the big boss"" (where? where?), ""let's get it on""
we took a bow and made a stand, started swaying with the hand
the sudden motion made me skip, now we're into a brand new trick

everybody was kung fu fighting
those cats were fast as lightning
in fact it was a little bit frightening

a summer's day laughin' and a-hidin'

she was the color of the indian summer
and we shared the hours without number
until one day when the sky turned dark
and the winds grew wild
caught by the rain and blinded by the lightning
we rode the storm out there on thunder island

i held her close
until the storm passed
and we fell down laughing in the wet grass
both our bodies drying in the sunshine
sweet sunshine

so, sha la la la la la, my lady
in the sun with your dress undone
now every mile away and every day
cuts a little bit deeper
i'll remember the nights in the cool sand

never knew the meaning of a heartache
but then again, i've never lost at love before

somewhere down the road
maybe all these years will find some meaning

stand tall, don't you fall oh, don't go and do something foolish
you're feeling it like everyone, it's silly human pride
stand tall, don't you fall. don't go do something you'll regret later
you're feeling it like everyone, it's silly human pride

never lasted so long
or through so much - or through so many
i just can't believe i could throw it all away

sometimes late at night
when there's nothing here except my old piano
i'd almost give my hands to make you see my way

chorus
stand tall, don't you fall oh, don't go and do something foolish
you're feeling it like everyone, it's silly human pride;
you got me down on my knees for ya, mama
stand tall, don't you fall. donn't go do something you'll regret later
you're feeling it like everyone, it's silly human pride"

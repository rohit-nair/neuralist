best and your\nIntentions aren't to bother me, but honestly I'd rather be\nSomewhere with my people, we can kick it and just listen to\nSome music with a message, (like we usually do)\nAnd we'll discuss our big dreams, how we plan, to take over the planet\nSo pardon my manners, I hope you'll understand that I'll be here (ooh)\nNot there in the kitchen\nWith the girl who's always gossipin' about her friends\nOh tell them I'll be here\n(Ooh) right next to the boy who's throwin' up\n'Cause he can't take what's in his cup no more\nOh God why am I here?\n\nOh oh oh here, oh oh oh here\nOh oh oh I asked myself, what am I doin' here?\nOh oh oh here, oh oh oh here\nAnd I can't wait 'til we can break up out of here\n\nHours later congregatin' next to the refrigerator\nSome girl's talkin' 'bout a hater, she ain't got none\nHow did it ever come to this? I should've never come to this\nSo holla at me, I'll be in the car when you're done\nI'm stand-offish, don't want what you're offerin'\nAnd I'm done talkin', awfully sad it had to be that way\nSo tell my people when they're ready that I'm ready\nAnd I'm standin' by the TV with my beanie low\nYo I'll be over here\n\nOh oh oh here, oh oh oh here\nOh oh oh I asked myself, what am I doin' here?\nOh oh oh here, oh oh oh here\nAnd I can't wait 'til we can break up out of here (oh oh, oh oh)", "tags": ["contemporary r&b", "electropop"], "num_syllables": 570.6, "pos": 94, "year": 2015, "fog_index":
